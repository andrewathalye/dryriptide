# No Border

## Description

Removes all effects from custom world borders and sets the world border to 60M wide client-side.
Note: This is likely not allowed on non-anarchy servers. Use at your own risk.
This has no effect on border damage, but allows (attempting) to place blocks and crossing the border directly.
